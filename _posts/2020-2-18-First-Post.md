Hi there!  
Welcome to my blog/website/portfolio, and to the first post.

Here I plan on posting things mainly for my portfolio, but I might end up doing some other stuff as well.
We'll see how things turn out as we proceed!

So, who am I?
My name is Bilal, and I'm a 24 year old Game Developer from Sweden.  
Or rather I plan to be one, I'm not one in a professional capacity at the very least(... yet)!  
I'm currently studying my last semester of Computer Game Development at Stockholm University and my focuses are Programming and Game Design.

I've put some more info in the [about](../about/) section, so feel free to check that out!

Otherwise that's all for now!  
Until next time, thanks for reading!
