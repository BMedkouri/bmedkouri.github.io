Hi there!
This project is (mainly) about optimization in Unity and I'll be going over a few different approaches to setting up basic AI as well as some other systems, and how these
approaches differ in performance. 
I've created a little game/simulation starring "bandits" that run around the map, and as soon as they spot another bandit, they'll take aim and fire.
